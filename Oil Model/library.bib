abstract = {A survey of applications of control theory to macroeconomics is presented. control theory has been applied to about fifty different macroeconomic models containing anywhere froni one to inure than three hundred equations, and including models of the economies of the United States, canada, United Kingdom. West Germany, France, Belgium. Australia and the Netherlands. A wide range of control theory methods has been applied to these models. Deterministic methods for both quadratic - linear and general nonlinear models have been used. Uncertainty has been introduced in the form of an additive noise to the systems equations and in the form of uncertainty about parameter values, and the models have been solved either with closed loop policies and/or open loop optimal feedback policies. Also, adaptive control procedures have begun to he used on the smaller models. in addition there have been a Jew applications of decentralized control techniques and of differential games.},

abstract = {The dynamics of the marketplace are amenable to a bond graph description. Franksen pointed out that the economic laws of Walras are the equivalents of the Kirchhoff laws and that this implied a network or structural aspect of the marketplace. We begin with this observation and fully develop the sign and signal-flow conventions. More importantly, we conduct a survey of the economics and related literatures in order to recast the conventional theory into the form of constitutive relations. That work is summarized and extended in this paper. Other new contributions described are associated with economic populations. (An instance of such a population is a group of machines, each of which undergoes a life cycle and then is replaced, refueled or maintained.) The discussion is illustrated with examples. One example is a simple market whose dynamics are characterized by a chaotic attractor, another example is a bond graph of the recycling of a commodity. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The consequent advantages are exemplified in different production models, treating, for instance, capacity requirements and safety stock problems. The main literature in this field concerns assembly systems, but the approach is easily applicable to process industries with a divergent material flow or when feedback is essential.},

abstract = {During the 1970s, oil market models offered a framework for understanding the growing market power being exercised by major oil producing countries. Few such models have been developed in recent years. Moreover, most large institutions do not use models directly for explaining recent oil price trends or projecting their future levels. Models of oil prices have become more computational, more data driven, less structural and increasingly short run since 2004. Quantitative analysis has shifted strongly towards identifying the role of financial instruments in shaping oil price movements. Although it is important to understand these short-run issues, a large vacuum exists between explanations that track short-run volatility within the context of long-run equilibrium conditions. The theories and models of oil demand and supply that are reviewed in this paper, although imperfect in many respects, offer a clear and well-defined perspective on the forces that are shaping the markets for crude oil and refined products.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Although the text is written in a somewhat critical manner, I look on most of the statements as propositions for further consideration and discussion rather than as facts which I accept at face value. While my general propositions suggest that current economic model design techniques are not progressing in the most fruitful direction, it is certainly true that those avenues needed to be explored, that most of the efforts represent some progress, and that they provide a foundation from which we can hope to build a better system of economic and industrial firm models using techniques and machines which have become available in the last decade. {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

Economics should become a systems profession, such as management, engineering, and medicine. By closely observing the structures and policies in business and government, simulation models can be constructed to answer questions about business cycles, causes of major depressions, inflation, monetary policy, and the validity of descriptive economic theories. A system dynamics model, as a general theory of economic behavior, now endogenously generates business cycles, Kuznets cycles, the economic long wave, and growth. A model is a theory of the behavior that it generates. The economic model provides the theory, thus far missing from economics, for the Great Depression of the 1930s and how such episodes can recur 50-70years apart. Simpler system dynamics models can become the vehicle for a relevant and exciting pre-college economics education. {\textcopyright} 2013 System Dynamics Society.},

Oil prices are determined by a "price rule" that includes market conditions and OPEC behaviour.

abstract = {Leveraging the advanced estimation and control algo- rithms for power systems have always been associated with the renewable energy sources, rational power generation, consumer stimulus, emission reduction, as well as econom- ically viable objectives. The model predictive control (MPC) strategies, that employ an economic-related cost function for real-time control, has lately proved a numerically efficient approach to managing the portfolio of energy usage in vari- ous residential and industrial projects. They are designated as economic MPCs, whose main endeavour is to cope with regularly changing energy prices. Unlike the traditional MPCs, economic MPCs optimize the process operations in a time-varying fashion, rather than maintain the process variables around a few desired steady states. The process may thus totally operate in the transient state with economic MPCs. This paper provides a rigorous review on the devel- oped and progressive economic MPCs, as a contribution to the field while it is still in its infancy. In the second part of the paper, we briefly showthe potential of applying the quadratic dissipativity constraint, previously introduced, to the closed- loop stability problem of an economic MPC problem.},

These variables "Granger cause" real oil prices but real oil prices do not "Granger cause" these variables. These results imply that OPEC influences oil prices and that previous models cannot be used to test competing models for OPEC production behavior.

abstract = {Oil is (an important) part of a larger global energy market, which is expected to see continued consumption growth (largely in emerging markets) and a continued shift toward natural gas and renewable forms of energy. While oil continues to lose market share, overall consumption and production are likely to continue growing- though more slowly than they have in the past due to expected policy changes aimed at slowing oil's growth as well as the impact of higher prices seen in recent years. Consumption in OECD countries has likely peaked; the growth in global oil use will be entirely due to continued growth in emerging economies, most importantly China. Oil supply growth will be dominated by OPEC, although non-OPEC supply should continue rising modestly due to biofuels and other 'unconventional' supplies. This outlook suggests that the centers of gravity for both consumption and production will shift-to Asia for consumption and to Middle-East OPEC for production. Continued investment will be required for supply to meet expected demand growth; energy security will remain an important driver of policy (though U.S. import dependence should improve); and CO2 emissions appear likely to continue rising. Market-oriented policies can help address the twin challenges of sustainability and security.},

First, we show that the cross-equation restrictions of a SVAR impose a nonlinear relation between the short-run price elasticities of oil supply and oil demand. This relation implies that seemingly plausible restrictions on oil supply elasticity may map into implausible values of the oil demand elasticity, and vice versa. Second, we propose an identification scheme that restricts these elasticities by minimizing the distance between the elasticities allowed by the SVAR and target values that we construct from a survey of relevant studies. Third, we use the identified SVAR to analyze sources and consequences of movements in oil prices. We find that (1) oil supply shocks and global demand shocks explain 50 and 35 percent of oil price fluctuations, respectively; (2) a drop in oil prices driven by supply shocks boosts economic activity in advanced economies, whereas it depresses economic activity in emerging economies; and (3) the selection of oil market elasticities is essential for understanding the source of oil price movements and to measuring the multipliers of oil prices on economic activity.},

abstract = {Inspired in dynamic systems theory and Brewer's contributions to apply it to economics, this paper establishes a bond graph model. Two main variables, a set of inter-connectivities based on nodes and links (bonds) and a fractional order dynamical perspective, prove to be a good macro-economic representation of countries' potential performance in nowadays globalization. The estimations based on time series for 50 countries throughout the last 50 decades confirm the accuracy of the model and the importance of scale for economic performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for maintaining corporate profitability and inventory targets in a dynamic business environment by adjusting price and production rates. Maintaining profitability targets is possible during periods of dynamic raw material costs, dynamic product prices, changes in supply due to plant outages or competitor changes, and changes in demand due to natural disasters. Control of inventory levels either to maintain a steady state inventory level or to maximise profits from existing inventory stocks during periods of plant downtime is also possible. This discussion provides an analytical framework showing the forces acting upon a company along with control methods using price.Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management (2006) 5, 174–183. doi:10.1057/palgrave.rpm.5160047 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Brewer1982a,
abstract = {Bond graphs are succinct, pictorial statements of mathematical models. These statements are so precise that computers can be programmed to derive sets of differential equations from them: the so-called state variable equations. Previously, bond graphs have been used to describe physical systems only; however, in this paper the authors extend the method to the analysis of nonlinear, dynamic economic systems. An explicit set of rules is provided for the construction of economic bond graphs and for the step by step derivation of the state equations. The use of the rules is illustrated with a large number of examples. {\textcopyright} 1982.},
