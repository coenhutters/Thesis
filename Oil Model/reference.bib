abstract="The essence of stock--flow analyses of individual or market behaviour is an explicit recognition of the interdependence of current production, consumption and asset-holding plans. The term `stock--flow analysis' is used here generically to refer to any theories dealing simultaneously with the economic activities of production, consumption and asset-holding. At a market level this implies a distinction between plans to purchase a good in the current period in order to consume it during the current period (flow demand) and for the purpose of holding it at the end of the current period as an asset (stock demand), and an analogous distinction between plans to supply the good from current production (flow supply) and past production (inventories, or stock supply). In this essay we review the nature of the distinction between stocks and flows and then illustrate the importance of the distinction for alternative theories of market price determination. Detailed references to the folklore of the stock--flow literature may be found in Burstein (1982), Bushaw and Clower (1957), Clower (1968) and Harrison (1980). We focus here on markets: see Archibald and Lipsey (1958), Clower (1963), Clower and Burstein (1960), Hadar (1965, 1971; ch. 11) and Johnson (1971) for important contributions to theories of individual behaviour in a stock-flow environment.",

abstract = {Societies are highly reliant on power systems for their energy needs. Reliability assessment is performed in both planning and operation of these power systems. Although there has been increasing interest in hardening the power system to be resilient against power outages, the risk of power outages cannot be completely diminished. Numerous models and algorithms are available to predict hazards that subsequently result in loss of energy services to customers. Many quantitative and qualitative approaches to determining restoration strategies in the event of a power outage have been developed. Very few studies have assessed restoration strategies in response to the risk of predicted hazards. As a result of the hurricanes and storms that have damaged critical infrastructures in the U.S. in recent years, this has become a burgeoning area for active research. In this literature survey we present the various studies that have been completed to date and discuss potential areas for future research.}
